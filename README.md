# Real-time-Detection-and-Translation-System-for-American-Sign-Language-ASL

## Technologies

###### Python - OpenCV2, Pandas, MediaPipe, OS, Sklearn, Toglib,

## Context

This project originated from the need to create a technological solution that facilitates communication for individuals using ASL, as well as for those looking to learn this language. The goal is to bridge the gap between deaf or non-verbal individuals and the rest of society by providing an accessible and effective tool for visual communication. Through this project, we aim to promote inclusion and accessibility for all, recognizing the diversity of communication modes.

## American Sign Language “ASL”

ASL is much more than just a set of gestures. It is a complete language with its own grammar, syntax, and distinct vocabulary. Primarily used in the United States and Canada, ASL offers a means of expression for individuals whose vocal communication is limited or absent. Its richness and complexity make it a powerful mode of communication adaptable to a wide variety of contexts.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the ASL detection system are as follows:

###### • Development of a robust system capable of detecting ASL in real time.  
###### • Use of MediaPipe for extracting relevant hand points.  
###### • Design of a training and testing database.  
###### • Creation of the Machine Learning model.  
###### • Testing the model.  
###### • Providing an intuitive user interface to interact with the system.
